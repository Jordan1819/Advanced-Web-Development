    <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://minikatana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mini Katana</a></h3>
    <img src="images\miniKatana.jpg" alt="Mini Katana Homepage">
    <p>This website is an excellent example of visual heirarchy because it is easy to see that the page has been laid out
        via order of importance. The menu bar, company name, and link the the user's shopping cart are all easy to find and emphasized
        at the top of the page. These are the most important elements on the page and it was a good design choice to put them at the top of
        the website so users always have quick access to them. Below these elements the homepage lists the most popular products, beginning
        with a high resolution image of the product, the name, and the price. Even within the individual product pages we see examples
        of a visual heirarchy being established.

    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://lvrgsports.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leverage Sports</a></h3>
    <img src="images\lvgSports.jpg" alt="Leverage Sports Homepage">
    <p>The homepage for Leverage Sports is a good example of the rule of thirds because their homepage image and banner are off centered.
        The rule of thirds emphasizes the importance of the subject of the photo being in the left or right 1/3 of the image itself.
        Leverage sports has done this with their mission statement floating to the left of the centered banner photo.
        They emphasized the subject of the header (their mission statement) using the rule of thirds while maintaining
        a clean centered banner image to act as a background of sorts.

    <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://unpigeon.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unpigeon</a></h3>
    <img src="images\unpigeon.jpg" alt="Unpigeon Homepage">
    <p>Hick's Law essentially states that the more information or choices that someone has, the longer it will take for them to make
        a decision. Unpigeon's homepage emphasizes the beauty of simplicity in web design. While many other sites
        will need to have more options and information for users it is important to remember that
        the more condensed and readable a website, the quicker users will feel comfortable making a decision. In frontend design,
        one of our top priorities is ensuring that users are able to find what they're looking for and see only what they need to see.
