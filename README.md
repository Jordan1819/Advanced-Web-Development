# Overview

This project is my final result from an advanced Front-End Web Development course. The website features multiple pages, navigation menus, and a responsive design. The website is an example website for the Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce. It features a bright, cheery theme and content that the I.F C.O.C. would likely feature on their site. This site was designed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
