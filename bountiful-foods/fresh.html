    the user to build their own specialty drink.
    The form requires the following items from the user:
    first name,
    email,
    phone number,
    three (3) select element inputs that are populated with 
    the available fruit to put into a drink.
    Populate all three select elements with 
    all of the available fruits.
    Available fruit options must only come 
    from this JSON data source for full credit
