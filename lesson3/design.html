<h2 class="typographyHeader">Typography Choices</h2>
<p>For this website, I chose to use the Times New Roman font. This is a site that
     aims to draw in and provide service to professionals in every realm and industry. That 
     professionalism should be reflected in the font choice. Times New Roman is a simplistic, 
     common, and efficient font choice because it will get the job done without distracting 
     target audience members from the purpose of their visit.

<h2 class="colorHeader">Color Schema</h2>
<p>I chose to use a calming and simple green color schema for this site. The color schema 
    should not distract visitors with multiple bright colors, as this could convey a lack of 
    professionalism or focus on our end. The green color also flows well with the banner image and 
    creates a feeling a visual completeness while maintaining simplicity in design. The white colored text 
    that has been applied to the head, nav, and footer text really helps the text pop out from 
    the green background. White is also very neutral and doesn't clash with the color choices 
    in other elements of the site.
